A classic example of thread communication involving conditions is the relationship
between a producer thread and a consumer thread. The producer thread produces data
items to be consumed by the consumer thread. Each produced data item is stored in a
shared variable.
Imagine that the threads are running at different speeds. The producer might
produce a new data item and record it in the shared variable before the consumer
retrieves the previous data item for processing. Also, the consumer might retrieve the
contents of the shared variable before a new data item is produced.
To overcome those problems, the producer thread must wait until it’s notified that
the previously produced data item has been consumed, and the consumer thread must
wait until it’s notified that a new data item has been produced.
